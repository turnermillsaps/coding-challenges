The man who would be King!:
Men come from all around to find out who will be king.
The legend says that whomever possess the sword at the end of the trial will be king.
The trial is simple:
The men go one at a time killing the man next to them with the sword and then passing it on.
The first man always gets the sword first and kills the man next in line, the sword then passes to the next living man in line and it repeats in a circle until only one man remains. The King!
Solve this problem with Perl, assume that the number of participants is set at the beginning of the trial so no need to worry about new comers.
